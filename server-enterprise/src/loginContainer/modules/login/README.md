## Prerequisites

You need to have Redis installed and to have the service running. To check if you have a service running just hit the following command and see the output like below:

```bash
‚ùØ brew services
Name       Status  User  Plist
postgresql started apple /Users/me/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
redis      started apple /Users/me/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist
```

Refer to [this link](https://tableplus.com/blog/2018/10/how-to-start-stop-restart-redis.html) on how to do this.
